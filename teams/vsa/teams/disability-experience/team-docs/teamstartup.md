      -No unknowns
      -Generally speaking, could be done in a day or less
   -2
      -Very specific
      -Like a 1, but may have other related tasks or dependencies that take times
      -Relatively trivial but will likely take more than a day to complete
   -3
      -May be 2-3 closely related tasks, each of which is simple
      -May not be super simple, but work of this kind has been done before
   -5
      -We will have to learn some new things, but we are confident in how long that will take
      -May be more cognitively demanding work, like synthesis
      -Small group of closely related tasks that cannot be separated
   -8
      -Some unknowns, it is hard to tell how much work will be involved from the start
      -Large group of closely related tasks that *might* be able to be separated
   -13+

      -Cannot be completed in one sprint by one person, needs multiple people
